## Task Description
Goal: To work as a group to create a website utilizing git and GitHub. Demonstrate understanding of git commands and GitHub workflow.

Assignment: Choose a cause that your group really cares about and put together a small informational website using HTML/CSS trying to convince people to donate to or help out this cause. This site should be 2-3 pages and look as professional as possible using modern design trends. Research similar websites to get inspiration.

Once you have decided on a cause, begin by selecting one teammate to create a Git repo with an index.html file, push it to GitHub, then add the other teammates as collaborators on the repo. Throughout this workshop each teammate should be communicating often and using GitHub effectively. Remember no one should be working off Master so create branches, resolve merge conflicts, and create and close issues.
